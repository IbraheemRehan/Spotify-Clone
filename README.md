##  How to Run the Project

This project **must be run through a local web server**. Browsers do not allow fetching files directly via `file://` due to security restrictions.

###  Recommended: VS Code + Live Server

1. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**
2. Install the **Live Server** extension
3. Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**

Your app will open at:  
`http://127.0.0.1:5500`

##  Deployment Warning

This project uses JavaScript to dynamically load local folders and audio files. Unfortunately, **GitHub Pages and most static hosting platforms do not support directory listing or file system access** via JavaScript due to browser and server security restrictions.

###  To deploy online, use one of the following options:

- **Netlify** or **Vercel** with custom rewrite rules or serverless functions
- **Firebase Hosting** with proper folder configuration
- **Node.js / Express** backend serving files manually
- Any hosting provider that supports server-side folder browsing or API-based file access

If you need help setting up deployment with any of these, feel free to reach out.

##  Project Status

This is a portfolio-level frontend project made to simulate a music player like Spotify. It focuses on dynamic JavaScript logic and browser audio control.
